## Course

This work is developed for the course **PH5730 - Methods of Computational Physics**.

## Description

Variational Monte Carlo is a stochastic method used to approximate the ground state energy and wavefunction of quantum systems by optimizing trial wavefunctions. This project demonstrates VMC techniques on:

- The quantum harmonic oscillator, a fundamental model with an exactly known solution.
- Hydrogen-like atoms, exploring one-electron systems with Coulomb potential.
- The hydrogen molecule, examining the simplest multi-electron molecular system.
